Binary Trees are heirachical data structures.
They are used to store data in heirarchy.
whenever a tree is created, you must first make the node.

Below is an example
class Node:
    # constructor 
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data 
        self.left = None 
        self.right = None 

#create a main function to create the tree 

def main():
    root = Node(1)
    root.left = Node(2)
    root.right = Node(3)
    root.left.left = Node(4)
    root.left.right = Node(5)
    root.right.left = Node(6)
    # etc

main()
